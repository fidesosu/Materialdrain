# Important
I apologize if you try to build and run the app. Currently the github repo probably doesn't have all the necessary files needed to build it from source. I'll try to get them all in near future. 

In the mean time please use the built apps in the Releases page.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Status

Every feature listed under "Available Now" or "In Development / Planned" in this README is intended for implementation and will almost definitely be implemented as long as pixeldrain remains a functional service. 

The app also needs some optimizations concerning the download and upload speed (currently 8-10MB/s, it's usable, but it can definitely be increased.)
